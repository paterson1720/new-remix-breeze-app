# but if you want to use a different database like PostgreSQL, you can easily do so by specifying the datasource db provider
# in the prisma/schema.prisma file and setting the DATABASE_URL environment variable to the connection string of your database.
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# App variables
APP_DOMAIN="example.dev" # Required in production
